Eight previous years of students have pored over this material, so good luck.

\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.11.1}{I grew up near Boston, Massachusetts. I went to Caltech and got a BS and MS in mathematics. I got a PhD in mathematics \(combinatorics\) from M.I.T.}{section.11}% 47
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.11.2}{After getting my PhD, I briefly taught mathematics at Rutgers University. I then got a job as a portfolio manager for a small firm in New York City. I managed portfolios \(equity and derivatives\) using quantitative methods. We will talk about some of the theories I and others used in this class. Eventually I moved into risk management, which I found more interesting because it is less narrowly focused than portfolio management.}{section.11}% 48
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.11.3}{I was the chief risk officer at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in New York, and also worked in ``sell side'' \(broker-dealer\) risk at Morgan Stanley. I came back to Pasadena in 2008 to work as the chief risk officer at Western Asset Management, which \(1\) manages about \044410 billion; and \(2\) is right down Colorado Blvd here in Pasadena.}{section.11}% 49
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.11.4}{While I was at Morgan Stanley, I was an adjunct professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. I taught a class in Capital Markets and Portfolio Theory there; that class was a bit similar to BEM 104 at Caltech.}{section.11}% 50
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.11.5}{Despite the fact that we are in the humanities \046 social sciences division, this is basically an applied mathematics class. Reasonably trained Caltech students who meet the prerequisites should be able to handle it, but it will definitely be more quantitative than qualitative. Today's class is by far the least quantitative, but it will give you the flavor of what we'll do.}{section.11}% 51
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.11.6}{The math level should be accessible by junior/senior undergraduates and graduate students. For sophomores and frosh it probably gets increasingly hard to follow - although both of those class years have taken and passed the class. But there's probably more catch-up work if you're in an earlier class.}{section.11}% 52
\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.11.7}{Some people found handling the concepts challenging and others found them quite easy. Don't feel shy if you are challenged \205 just ask questions. No matter how smart you are, it's hard to keep up with live mathematical exposition: if I weren't the one giving the lecture, I would probably fall behind listening to it from time to time. So \(as I said previously!\) do everyone a favor and ask when you're getting behind.}{section.11}% 53

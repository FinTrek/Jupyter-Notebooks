I managed portfolios (equity and derivatives) using quantitative methods. We will talk about some of the theories I and others used in this class. Eventually I moved into risk management, which I found more interesting because it is less narrowly focused than portfolio management.\n",

I came back to Pasadena in 2008 to work as the chief risk officer at Western Asset Management, which (1) manages about $410 billion; and (2) is right down Colorado Blvd here in Pasadena."

Reasonably trained Caltech students who meet the prerequisites should be able to handle it, but it will definitely be more quantitative than qualitative. Today’s class is by far the least quantitative, but it will give you the flavor of what we’ll do.\n",

For sophomores and frosh it probably gets increasingly hard to follow - although both of those class years have taken and passed the class. But there's probably more catch-up work if you're in an earlier class.\n",

No matter how smart you are, it’s hard to keep up with live mathematical exposition: if I weren’t the one giving the lecture, I would probably fall behind listening to it from time to time.

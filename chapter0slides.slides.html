<ul>
<li>## First class is January 8, 2019 from 10:30AM to 12 noon in Baxter 128.</li>
<li>## Professor is Kenneth Winston (kwinston@caltech.edu). My office is 236 Baxter. I am there after every class, and lots of other times. Email if you can't find me and want to set up a meeting.</li>
<li>## This is the ninth year I have taught this class. This Jupyter notebook is the textbook.</li>
<li>## I generally post the next week’s lectures on Sunday nights.</li>
<li>## This class requires a fair amount of time. You should plan to spend at least nine hours a week on the class between lectures, homework, tests, and general studying.</li>

<li>### You get 10 additional homework points (/100) for each major error you discover in my lecture slides or Python code. I am the sole judge of what constitutes a major error, but for example if I say “<em>Tesla, Inc. is a company that operates coal mines,</em>” that’s a major error. Eight previous years of students have pored over this material, so good luck. But I make a lot of changes each year, so that’s a rich source of new errors = bonus homework points.</li>
<li>### Use computers only for calculation. If you are taking an integral or a derivative, solve it yourself: don’t just say “Wolfram Alpha says the answer is…” And if you do use a computer for calculation, show enough intermediate steps to prove that you know how the theory works. I prefer well-commented Python code for assignments that require a computer.</li>

<li># 0.3 About me<ul>
<li>## I grew up near Boston, Massachusetts. I went to Caltech and got a BS and MS in mathematics. I got a <a href="http://library.mit.edu/F/Q8JTXL26J3NPYUXLRDKTT23VIQDVLPAULXANI2M5NIR7C4HF27-10935?func=find-acc&amp;acc_sequence=006127219">PhD in mathematics (combinatorics) from M.I.T</a>.</li>
<li>## After getting my PhD, I briefly taught mathematics at Rutgers University. I then got a job as a portfolio manager for a small firm in New York City. I managed portfolios (equity and derivatives) using quantitative methods. We will talk about some of the theories I and others used in this class. Eventually I moved into risk management, which I found more interesting because it is less narrowly focused than portfolio management.</li>
<li>## I was the chief risk officer at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in New York, and also worked in “sell side” (broker-dealer) risk at Morgan Stanley. I came back to Pasadena in 2008 to work as the chief risk officer at Western Asset Management, which (1) manages about $410 billion; and (2) is right down Colorado Blvd here in Pasadena.</li>

<li># 0.4 BEM 111 background<ul>
<li>## While I was at Morgan Stanley, I was an adjunct professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. I taught a class in Capital Markets and Portfolio Theory there; that class was a bit similar to BEM 104 at Caltech.</li>
<li>## Despite the fact that we are in the humanities &amp; social sciences division, this is basically an applied mathematics class. Reasonably trained Caltech students who meet the prerequisites should be able to handle it, but it will definitely be more quantitative than qualitative. Today’s class is by far the least quantitative, but it will give you the flavor of what we’ll do.</li>
<li>## The math level should be accessible to junior/senior undergraduates and graduate students. For sophomores and frosh it probably gets increasingly hard to follow - although both of those class years have taken and passed the class. But there's probably more catch-up work if you're in an earlier class.</li>
<li>## Some people found handling the concepts challenging and others found them quite easy. Don’t feel shy if you are challenged – just ask questions. No matter how smart you are, it’s hard to keep up with live mathematical exposition: if I weren’t the one giving the lecture, I would probably fall behind listening to it from time to time. So (as I said previously!) do everyone a favor and ask when you’re getting behind.</li>

<ul>
<li># 0.5 Class topic and prerequisites<ul>
<li>## This class is about financial risk management, with a tilt toward “buy side” risk management.<ul>
<li>### In the financial world, the “buy side” consists of institutions that invest money for clients. Examples are mutual funds, hedge funds, asset managers serving pension plans, college endowments, and sovereign wealth funds.</li>
<li>### The “sell side” consists of broker-dealers who execute transactions; these are mainly divisions of large banks.</li>
<li>### Of course buy side institutions both buy and sell, and sell side institutions both buy and sell, so these names are a bit confusing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>## Prerequisites: a solid undergraduate mathematics education. Knowledge of calculus, probability and statistics. If you have taken one or more of BEM 105, Ma 112, or ACM/ESE 118, you probably have the right background.</li>
